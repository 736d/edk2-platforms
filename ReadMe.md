### Download the required component

1. Create a new directory for an EDK II WORKSPACE.

2. Download below repository to this WORKSPACE:

edk2 repository
	``git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git``

edk2-platforms repository
	``git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git -b devel-MinPlatform``

edk2-non-osi repository
	``git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-non-osi.git -b devel-MinPlatform``

FSP repository
	``git clone https://github.com/IntelFsp/FSP.git -b KabylakeFsp0001``

### Build

For MinKabylake
1. Open command window, goto the workspace dir, e.g. c:\Kabylake.
2. Type "cd edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\KabylakeOpenBoardPkg\KabylakeRvp3".
3. Type "GitEdk2MinKabylake.bat" to setup GIT environment.
4. Type "prep" and make prebuild finish for debug build, "prep r" for rlease build.
5. Type "bld" to build kabylake BIOS image.

For MinPurley
1. Open command window, goto the workspace dir, e.g. c:\Purley.
2. Type "cd edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\PurleyOpenBoardPkg\BoardMtOlympus".
3. Type "GitEdk2MinMtOlympus.bat" to setup GIT environment.
4. Type "bld" to build Purley BIOS image, "bld release" for release build.

The user can run FITC tool to build full image for flash (BIOS + ME + DESC). The user can also burn the BIOS image to highest part of flash region directly.
